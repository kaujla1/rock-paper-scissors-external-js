# rock-paper-scissors-external-js

## Notes
This is a duplicate of my original rock-paper-scissors game but with the js stored in an external file. 

1. Add a "click me" button above the rps buttons that bounces (DONE)
2. Make it so the player and computer choice borders turn green or red depending on who wins the round (DONE)
3. Make it so the rps buttons glow when hovered over (DONE) 
4. Change "play again" button so that on click it just reloads the page? (DONE)
